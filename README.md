## Practice Projects
This section will contain various Python projects that I've worked on as part of my learning process. Each project focuses on different Python concepts and skills, helping me build a solid foundation.

## Datasets
Here you'll find datasets that I've used for practicing data analysis and other Python-related tasks. The datasets will often be accompanied by code that demonstrates how to process and analyze them.

## Notes
I keep notes on different Python concepts and topics as I learn. This includes syntax, best practices, tips, and explanations of more advanced topics.

## Resources
A collection of helpful resources I've found during my Python journey, such as:
- Online tutorials
- Books
- Blog articles
- Python documentation

## Libraries
As part of learning Python, I've explored various libraries that enhance Python's functionality. Some of the libraries covered in this repository include:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `matplotlib`: For creating visualizations
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning tasks

## GitHub Workflow
When working offline, use the following Git commands to push changes to this repository on GitHub:

1. Add all changes:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

2. Or, selectively add specific files:
    ```bash
    git add file1.txt file2.txt
    ```

3. Commit your changes with a meaningful message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Description of the changes"
    ```

4. Finally, push your changes to GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push
    ```
